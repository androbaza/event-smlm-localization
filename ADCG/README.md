# SparseInverseProblems
This julia package accompanies the paper "The Alternating Descent Conditional Gradient Method for Sparse Inverse Problems",
which should be available on the arxiv.

Install with `Pkg.clone("git@github.com:nboyd/SparseInverseProblems.jl.git")`.

In the new Julia version (v1.8) "Pkg.clone" does not exist anymore, it has been substituted by "Pkg.add". Nevertheless, the version available on Github cannot be cloned because it lacks the "Project.toml" and "Manifest.toml" files and it is based on the old Julia version (v0.4). Some commands have been changed in here with respect to the original package to make it work.


The files we are interest in are the contained in the folders "src" and "examples".
