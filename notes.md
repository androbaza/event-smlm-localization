# Aims of the project
* Generate localizations from the event-based SMLM data using phasor based localization method.
* Adapt the input data to perform localization using DECODE.
* Generate 3D localizations?

# Workflow
* Filter out the event salt-n-paper noise
* There is no background - no median filtering?
